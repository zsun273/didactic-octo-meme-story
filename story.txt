// Hi everyone! Welcome to Leo's GitHub story.

Thousands of years ago, there was a god named Dragon King. Although he had a magical power to ceate anything he wants. He felt lonely and boring. 

Thus he decided to take out his all-looking crystal ball and see what the humans are up to. "I command thee to show me the most interesting scene going on down in the human world," he commanded. The globe fogged pale silver and revealed a stunning scene. There was a boy and a girl playing on the beach, building sand castles. Their parents didn't seem to be there at all... 

"This is so boring," he thought,"What's the point of building sand castles? Either something's wrong with my crystal, or humans' world is boring." Then sunddenly, the crystal ball shined again and showed a R&R band palying music.
