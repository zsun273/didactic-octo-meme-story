// Hi everyone! Welcome to Leo's GitHub story.

Thousands of years ago, there was a god named Dragon King. Although he had a magical power to ceate anything he wants. He felt lonely and boring. 

Thus he decided to take out his all-looking crystal ball and see what the humans are up to. "I command thee to show me the most interesting scene going on down in the human world," he commanded. The globe fogged pale silver and revealed a stunning scene. There was a boy and a girl playing on the beach, building sand castles. Their parents didn't seem to be there at all... 

"This is so boring," he thought,"What's the point of building sand castles? Either something's wrong with my crystal, or humans' world is boring." Then sunddenly, the crystal ball shined again and showed a R&R band palying music.

Suddenly, Dragon King got an idea. He and his four other god buddies (Dragon Queen, Dragon Diva, Dragon Lord and Dragon Thunder) decided to transform themselves into humans inorder to form a new rock and roll band in the mortal world. Instantly, the humans were drawn to the powerful and firey music created by these talented dieties. The humans would never suspect that it was actually five dragon gods who created the band ACDC.
